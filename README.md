# Calculator
A calculator based on javascript.

I create this calculator in February in 2022.It should have been a very easy problem,but the prohibition of "eval" made it a little difficult.To solve that problem,I refered some solutions online.Finally,I imported a new function "calcExpression" made by Chice.And the new function solved the problem in the end.
